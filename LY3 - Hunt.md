# Babel Hunting Logs  
## LY3

We are going out with:
Zach and his twillight sword + rawhide, founding stone
Ascalon with 3 piece of screaming, cloth, founding stone, grease and luck charm 
Ace with bone dagger, cloth
Mantra with lantern sword, cloth, foudning stone. 

Ascalon is at 0 survival, the others are at 2

As they set out, they encounter a dead anteloppe. They manage to get a pelt, and steak and a crab spider before continuing 

While waling along, Ace found some Space between the rock to go check out. He come out with a new disorder (Anhedonia)

They then found a Pile of Vomit from the lope, Ace, Zack and Mantra all search the pile and gain +1 courage and +1 survival. (Ascalon doesn't since she has grease)

They arrive at the showdown
