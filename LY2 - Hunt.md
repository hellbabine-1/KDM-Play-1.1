# Babel Hunting Logs  
## LY2

We got Ascalon, Allister, Zack and Erza going out. 

Going out, the party quickly found a Dead Antelope. They quickly get ressources from it before leaving (pelt, shank bone, cyclop fly)

Shortly after, while walking on some path, a huge Sinkhole(event 77) appear beneath Erza. The others rush to get her out, but by the time they get to her, her cloth got destroyed. 

Continuing on, they encounter a field full of acanthus (Grazing Field). No one is hurt, so they don't need it.

While walking out of the grass field, another Sinkhole(event77) appear. This time, Zack is the one to fall in. He lost his founding stone before getting out. 

They finally arrive to their quarry.
