## LY 3

We get back home with 4 endeavor to spend. 

Random event this year is Stranger in the Dark. I rolled a a 10, so +1 pop and a founding stone. 

For the special rule, Zack is the one with the most damage (equal with ascalon), and he's missing 2 arm armor, so he gain the ability. The monster eat some of the monster hide they brought back

The guy that just came (Oracle) goes to talk with the pariah, and end up codependant. The monste give it a Love juice 

We innovate getting a choice between Inner lantern and Symposium. A hard choice, but we're taking Symposium. 

Our matchmaker Zack will make some babies with a random survivor (10 and a 1 !! No hovel so no savior :/ ) We're getting twins 

The first love juice gave us 1 baby. The second one gave us another set of twin (10 again !) Getting us over 15 pop.

We're going with collective toil, and rolled a 6. We got a broken lantern from the death, and got a lion tail(h) and great cat bone(b) and a skull. *Nice now we can keep the copper and use that broken lantern for the set*

We're crafting Screaming horn, and screaming leg. Also getting a screamin mint, dried acanthus, rawhide vest, skull helmet, and a bow scab. I'm keeping the rest to unlock some Setlement location next year. 

The last 2 endeavors go to giving zack and ascalon sync strike. 


## Decision

Ok so i'm getting a love juice from the Pariah to hit my Society. I really want that additional endeavor from collective toil. I was thinking about some scrap to keep the copper, but decided not to. 

This turned out great, i got some a lot of ressource, but with no amonia i kinda want to wait. I really want the scav kit, but don't have enough organ. So i'm keeping a lot of stuff back because i don't want to finish a second rawhide set. 

We are departing for pariah with

Mantra: rawhide head+body, founding stone, cloth. lantern sword, brain mint
Ascalon: full screamin, luck charm, grease, dried acanthus, and founding stone. 
Zack: full rawhide, 3 twillight items, founding stone *Zack will have the twillight cloak even if he hit 3 understanding this year. I'm not 100% on the ruling, but he since he's gaining it while departing, i,d say its fine* 
Scout: Bone helmet, bow scab, bone dagger, founding stone.
