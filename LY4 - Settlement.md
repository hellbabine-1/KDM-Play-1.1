## LY 4

Getting back to the settlement with 7 endeavors to spend (2 returning, 4 from pariah win, 1 from society)

The settlement decide to give the returnign survivors Nickname 

Ascalon is now known as the Dingle sneak of the Anteloppe, and Scout is the Dingle fool of the lion

Hand of heat is rolled by a new survivor (rolled a 3) They died, we get a monster hide from it. 

Ascalon is nominated for the FK event. She get the sleeping flower virus 

First thing first, we innovate. We get Cooking, Sculpture, Morgue and Records. We're going with Sculpture 

Scout will make a statue of otherwordly luck

Scout will also use Matchmaker. We get a newborn.

The remaining endeavor will got to give sync-strike to the hunting part, and otherworldy luck (from sculpture rolled a 8) to white smoke.

## Decision

Hand of heat roll was bad, i'm trying to make a new ok survivor over here... 

Innovating Sculpture the same year i get Otherworldy luck is crazy good. I might have taken Morgue otherwise since i'm at 10 dead already. 

I'm considering if i should hunt a level2 FK right now.

I think i'll go for it. I'll craft a bit more armor (rawhide boot) for it (and bandages.) to get clothed & satiated. 

We're departing for FK2

Ascalon: rawhide, brain mint, sleeping virus flower, luck charm, founding stone.  

White Smoke: screaming, bone dagger, founding stone grease, 

Herb: Bowscab, skull helm, cloth, founding stone, rawhide boot, bandages. 

Oracle: Lantern sword, rawhide headband + body, cloth
