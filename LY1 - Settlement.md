## LY 1 

Near the settlement, our survivor see a huve open maw with some shinny in there. Allister decide to go in to try to get some ressources for the settlement. Bracing himself with some of the ressource they party brought back, he manage to find a fine sword. 

Seeing this, Scout decide to also go into the maw. He didn't find anything and barely make it out. (+2 courage, got matchmaker and +1 endeavor from bold, rolled 1, 4, 5 9)

More people from the settlement get the courage to go in. Erza is next, she also barely make it out. (+2 courage, got matchmaker and +1 endeavor from bold, rolled 1, 2, 5, 9)

Zack goes in, and make it out safely (+2 courage, got matchmaker and +1 accuracy from bold, 1, 4, 6, 10)

Vigna seem to develop a cough. She become the settlement Mere Navi and get the Feral Shout FA

The settlement is suddently disturbed by the screams of some animal. Ascalon step up to be the voice of reason, and gain the Orator of deaht FA. 

The settlement decide to innovate something new. They use some hide, bone and organ lying around to make some drums. 

The also finish up the organ grinder, just in time to make some stinky grease for Ascalon. They also finish up the Rawhide set.  

They decide to store the remaining Tatty hide and mossy molar. 


## Decision

Went with open maw again. I spend another 3 monster bone and a waxy dermis, trying for the sword and i got it again ! I rolled a 1, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, removing the two 1, it give barely the 32 needed for the sword. 

I wanted to try again to make some matchmaker, since i got +1 courage on all my hunting party last year. 

Erza, Scout and Zach managed to get the +2 courage, but no vermin. I'm not risking Ascalon in there, she'll need to be in full form to train F&T with the help of SadFrogSong and her +1Speed

I got a great roll on Lingering Cough for my Mere Navi, not that its going out any time soon. 

Ascalon got the courage for Endless screams, so she's at 2 now, and orator of death. 

For all the ressources I had, i only managed to finish the rawhide set and get some grease. I've got a Tatty hide and mossy molar left, but i want to keep the hide for the Screaming set, and there's no good use for the molar alone. I might end up hunting another frogdog for the spindly paw for the GrappleClaw. 

I also could have used some endeavor with matchmaker. But its not really urgent since i'm going PtY anyway. I guess double twin would get me to 15 pop, but its not really realistic. But i'm going out with 3 matchmaker, so maybe next year. 

Next year, we depart for the lope, with 

Ascalon: full rawhide, fouding stone, f&t, grease
Allister: Cloth, founding stone, Lanter sword. 
Zack: Bone Dart, cloth, founding stone
Erza: Bone Dagger, cloth, founding stone
