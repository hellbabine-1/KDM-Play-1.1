## LY 2

Acid that to pour down from the sky. Scout decide that its a good time to go run around in the rain, but quickly realise its a bad idea. He'll have to skip the next hunt to recover. 

The fiend arrive, killing an unnamed survivor (love juice from cannibalism). Then the monster eat a Shank bone and a monster organ. The settlement take its gift, and choose the the Eye of seer, giving the luck to Ascalon

I decided to innovate this year, getting the choice between Face painting and Pictographe. I went with face painting.

Ace and Mantra used the love juice to make a baby. First baby of the campaign is a 6. We got with PtY again. Both Parents get 2 survival and 1 evasion. 

Zach use his matchmaker skill to make another baby. 

A mysterious stranger arrive at the settlement. After some consideration, they shove a tattered parcel into Zach's hand, then leave with Unfinisehd business. 

The settlement craft the Screaming Coat, Bracer and Leg Warmer. They also make a luck charm.

Ascalon if feeling pretty couragous after her hard work in the showdown, and attempt to eat the cyclop fly they brought back. It work flawlessly, and she get +1 acc

## Decision

The plan initially was to have Zach and Ascalon continue on F&T duty, but since Zach got Twillight Sword, we're goin full out on Ascalon for it. With the new Screming set piece, she can activate the luck charm and with 1 luck already, she'll crit on 7, have some strenght anyway from her missed attack. Hopefully i can soon start to invest into synch strike too. 

Next year is gonna be another lope. I want to finish up the set, so i need 1 pelt. Hopefully i can also get a scrap so i won't have to use the copper for it. If i can also get enough organ, i could also get he scavenging kit, and maybe a ScabBow for the Pariah. The rawhide set will go on someone else, probably the lantern sword guy. Or maybe on zack, so he can fallback to support after getting his hit in with the twillight sword.  

We are going out with:
Zach and his twillight sword + rawhide, founding stone
Ascalon with 3 piece of screaming, cloth, founding stone, grease and luck charm 
Ace with bone dagger, cloth
Mantra with lantern sword, cloth, foudning stone. 

Update: I've craft another rawhide headband to activate the luck charm, idk why i didn't see that last time
