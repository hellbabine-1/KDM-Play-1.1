## LY 5

We got 4 endeavor to spend. 

This year's event is heat wave. White smoke will have to skip out this year to recover. 

We innovate. The choices are Inner Lantern, Song of the Brave, Cooking and Pictograph. We're taking inner lantern. 

Drifter came in, rolled a 1 on his event... 

We're making the Barber surgeon to make the scavkit this year. We're also making a bone club (we need a bit more firepower) and finished the second rawhide set (since no amonia yet, and i had 2 perishable left)

The last 2 endeavor are going to give Otherwordly luck to Herb(rolled a 9) and sync strike to Drifter. 


## Decision

Finally had enough Organ to make the barber surgeon and get the scav kit. 

I'm getting a bit concerned with my ability to hit higher toughness. Ascalon rely on crit or on missing some hit with sadfrogsong, and its been biting me in the ass a bit. 

Lantern sword is still good, and with the accuracy Herb got, Scab bow should be better. But i'm still missing something so i made a bone club. I have enough bone, i don't plan on making the weapon crafter (trying things out this campaign), so might as well. Drifter might end up using it since he can dash a ton, and position easily for synch strike. 

Next year, we're hunting a frogdog2. I want to start on that lantern. I haven't gotten bonus copper from terrain like last campaign, but i still have the one from prologue, and with otherwordly luck on a statue, it shouldn't be too bad. I would also like the google to scout Braal HL to throw some stone at her. 

No song of the brave is a bit annoying, and no ammonia too. I'd also really like to get hovel to get some savior and try to get Lucid dream... At least i got paint/symposium/inner lantern now. 

We're going out with : TODO
