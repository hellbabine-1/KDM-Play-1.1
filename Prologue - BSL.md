# Babel Story Logs
## Prologue

### Story

Our starting survivors find a hoard of lantern. Near the shinning beacon, they see 8 other survivors, and they decide to join an cooperate with them. After their initial contact, they develop a **Language** to communicate with each other, and decide to call themself Babel. Allister is nominated to chek on the settlement for the next year (he get the +1 understanding, +1 courage)

Now they need to decide what to do with the remain of Lucy. They survivors present pass to vote, and decided that they can't let the body go to waste if they want a chance to survive, and opt for **Cannibalism**. Ascalon get nominated to partake in the remains, gaining +1 speed 

With all the ressources left over from the monster, the settlement decide to innovate. They decide to use some of the blood as **Paint** to decorate the settlement. It could have been used as Amonia too, but this will be for later. 

With the rest of the ressources, they make a Bone Dagger, Bone Darts, and a Rawhide set (except the  Rawhide Pants). They only keep the copper. 

Next year departure will be Zack, Erza, Ascalon and Scout. 


### Decision 
Alright, here we go again. I'm probably doing the same principle choices, so cannibalism, later on PTY. 

I would have liked to get the long club, but innovating with my only organ is too attrackting right now. I got Paint and Amonia, decided to  go with Paint. 

With a lot of hide and 2 bone left, i can't really make good weapon, so its a bone dagger and bone dart + almost a full rawhide set. That more armor them the first 3 LY of my previous attemps :lucyJoy:
